JSON is not same as JS Objects

Js Objects can have variables
But JSON can't have variables and is used by other programming languages aswell

JSON.parse() is used to makes json into JS Object 
JSON.stringify() is used to make JS Object to JSON

python dictionary is not same as the json aswell
to convert python dictionary or object to a json we use json.dumps()


keep in mind that python dictionary and javascript objects and json all three are different and not same therefore use different methods to convert it to json first
